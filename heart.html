      <p>Hello My Love!!<br>
I know I hurt you today…<br>
a little with my words and a little with my actions, even if I never meant to.<br>
My heart feels so heavy for causing you pain.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <p>But it wasn’t only me, my heart…<br>
You too said things that pierced me deeply,<br>
accusations and words that I know came from frustration, not from the love we share.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <p>Still, I listened to it all because you mean everything to me.<br>
But in the end, I couldn’t hold back my feelings and I reacted badly.<br>
For that, I feel so, so guilty.<br>
I should have stayed calm, and I’m truly sorry for losing control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
      <p>I should never have behaved that way.<br>
<b>I am really, really sorry.</b><br>
Can we please leave this behind and start fresh?<br>
Both of us made mistakes, both of us spoke in anger.<br>
Let’s not let a misunderstanding overshadow the beautiful love we have.<br>
In just one month, we’ll celebrate <b>8 wonderful years together!</b><br>
Isn’t that something worth protecting with all our hearts?<br>
Please understand, my love, I only want us to grow closer and happier.<br>
